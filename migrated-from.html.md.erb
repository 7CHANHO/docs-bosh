title: Renaming/migrating Deployment Jobs
---

Occasionally it's convenient to rename one or more deployment jobs as their purpose changes or as better names are found. In most cases it's desirable to maintain existing persistent data by keeping existing persistent disks.

Previously the CLI provided `rename job` command to rename specific job one at a time. That approach worked OK in an non-automated, non-frequently updated environments, but it was inconvenient for automated, frequently updated environments. As a replacement `migrated_from` directive was added to allow renames to happen in a more systematic way.

Additionally `migrated_from` directive can be used to migrate deployment jobs to using first class AZs.

## <a id="rename"></a> Renaming Jobs

1. Given follow deployment job `etcd`:

    ```yaml
    jobs:
    - name: etcd-primary
      instances: 2
      templates:
      - {name: etcd, release: etcd}
      persistent_disk: 10_240
      resource_pool: medium
      networks:
      - name: default
    ```

1. Change job's name to `etcd` and add `migrated_from` with a previous name.

    ```yaml
    jobs:
    - name: etcd
      instances: 2
      templates:
      - {name: etcd, release: etcd}
      persistent_disk: 10_240
      resource_pool: medium
      networks:
      - name: default
      migrated_from:
      - name: etcd-primary
    ```

1. Deploy.

## <a id="migrate"></a> Migrating Jobs (to first class AZs)

Before the introduction of first class AZs, each deployment job was associated with a resource pool that typically defined some CPI specific AZ configuration in its `cloud_properties`. Typically there would be multiple deployment jobs that mostly differed by their name, for example `etcd_z1` and `etcd_z2`. With first class AZs, multiple deployment jobs typically should be collapsed to simplify the deployment.

1. Given following deployment jobs `etcd_z1` and `etcd_z2` with AZ specific resource pools and networks:

    ```yaml
    jobs:
    - name: etcd_z1
      instances: 2
      templates:
      - {name: etcd, release: etcd}
      persistent_disk: 10_240
      resource_pool: medium_z1
      networks:
      - name: default_z1

    - name: etcd_z2
      instances: 1
      templates:
      - {name: etcd, release: etcd}
      persistent_disk: 10_240
      resource_pool: medium_z2
      networks:
      - name: default_z2
    ```

1. Collapse both jobs into a single job `etcd` and use `migrated_from` with previous job names.

    ```yaml
    jobs:
    - name: etcd
      instances: 3
      templates:
      - {name: etcd, release: etcd}
      persistent_disk: 10_240
      resource_pool: medium
      networks:
      - name: default
      migrated_from:
      - {name: etcd_z1, az: z1}
      - {name: etcd_z2, az: z2}
    ```

<p class="note">Note that other referenced resources such as resource pool and network should be adjusted to work with AZs.</p>

<p class="note">Note: Migration from one AZ to a different AZ is not supported yet.</p>

1. Deploy.
